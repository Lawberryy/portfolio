# Mon portfolio

### Here are the steps that I followed for this project :

1. I created an account on vercel.com by signing in through github.
Vercel has now access to the list of all my github repositories. 

2. I then imported my portfolio repository on vercel.
The repository is now online (the deployment is done).

3. The next step is to install Checkly.
To do that, I went on the deployments page on Vercel, then in the "rinning checks" section, I clicked on the CTA button to install Checkly.
I followed the steps displayed on the screen (for the free installation) and then it was done.
Now each commit & push is tracked on vercel on the project page.

4. The next step is to install the ImgBot extension on my Github.
I went on the maretplace page and found the extension in the list. I added it to my account, and more specifically to my portfolio repository only.
Then if you commit & push once more, a new branch is supposed to be added on the repository called "imgbot".

5. I went through the marketplace again to find other interesting extensions (in my opinion) to install for my repo.

--> The first one I chose was the recommended app "WhiteSource Bolt Mend", to improve the security aspect.

--> To improve workflow & code management, I installed the "CodeFactor" app.
If I have issues in several repositories, I can now have access to them all in one dashboard.


6. Finally, I created an account on Zapier and I created two zap between Github & Discord.
The first one is the mandatory one : Create a bot that notify you (send a message in the Discord channel of my server) when a new commit is done.
The second one create a bot that also send a message when a new repository is created.
